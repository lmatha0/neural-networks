neural networks:

protein classification:
- A feed forward neural network to showcase the concepts used in a simple neural network system. implemented a 2 layer hidden network architecture to understand forward propagation and backward propagation between each layer
- used to classify proteins based on parameters including resolution, pH, molecular weight, density and more
- created from scratch using pandas to load data and numpy to perform calculations. also used scikitlearn to normalize and split data into train/test sets
- dataset was very large and difficult to clean, resulting in an accuracy of about 58% and a loss that was slightly increasing
- will extend to a neural network with an arbitrary number of hidden networks using another dataset
